# Computerlink Error Codes

This page summarizes TOYOPUC Computerlink response errors that users commonly see. It is not a complete manufacturer code table; use the JTEKT TOYOPUC manuals for formal definitions.

## Common PLC Error Codes

| Code | Typical cause | First check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x40` | Address or address plus count is outside the CPU range. This is also the common result when FR is not exposed on the tested unit. | Check the selected profile, address range, and count. |
| `0x24` | Subcommand is not supported by the CPU or routed target. | Check whether the feature exists on that CPU; for example some targets reject `A0`. |
| `0x23` | Command code is not supported. | Check the selected helper and profile. |
| `0x31` | Write or function call is prohibited while the sequence is running. | Check PLC run/write settings before retrying. |
| `0x34` | Access is prohibited by configuration. | Check PLC communication and protection settings. |
| `0x41` | Word or byte count is outside the permitted range. | Split the request or reduce the count. |
| `0x52` | Timer/counter set-value and current-value command type do not match. | Check whether the helper targets a preset or current value. |
| `0x66`, `0x70`, `0x72` | Relay link module did not answer or could not execute the request. | Check relay hops and the target PLC path. |
| `0x73` | Relay command collision on the same link module; retry is appropriate. | Retry after a short delay or reduce concurrent relay access. |
| `0x11` | CPU module hardware failure. | Check the PLC CPU status before continuing. |

## First Checks

- Confirm that Computerlink communication is enabled on the PLC side.
- Confirm the TCP/UDP port and network settings in the [TOYOPUC setup page](toyopuc.md).
- Confirm that the application selected the canonical TOYOPUC profile.
- For write errors, check PLC run/write permission and protection settings before retrying.
